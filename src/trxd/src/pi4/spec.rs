//! The PI4 "Next Generation Beacon" protocol: OZ2M / Klaus DJ5HG's
//! specification (<https://rudius.net/oz2m/ngnb/pi4_.htm>), read from source —
//! every constant and every bit-ordering choice below was checked against that
//! page's own worked example (OZ7IGY at 144.471 MHz) rather than assumed from
//! its prose, and [`tests::the_oz7igy_worked_example_matches_the_protocol_page`]
//! is that check kept as a regression test.
//!
//! PI4 is explicitly "based on JT4", and it shows in the FEC: the rate-1/2
//! K=32 convolutional code is the Layland-Lushbaugh pair `0xF2D05351` /
//! `0xE4613C47` that WSPR and JT9 also use — literally the same code, only the
//! message length differs (42 info bits here against WSPR's 50 and JT9's 72).
//! `mfsk-core`'s `fec::conv::fano` module carries that code as a set of
//! functions generic over the bit count rather than as a type hard-wired to
//! WSPR's own shape, so it is reused here directly rather than re-implemented:
//! [`conv_encode`](mfsk_core::fec::conv::fano::conv_encode) and
//! [`fano_decode`](mfsk_core::fec::conv::fano::fano_decode) with
//! [`NBITS`] in place of `ConvFano::NBITS` (81) or `ConvFano232::NBITS` (103)
//! is the whole of it. What is PI4-specific and lives here: the message
//! alphabet and its base-38 packing, the fixed sync vector, and the
//! bit-reversal interleaver.
