//! Turning 12 kHz audio into per-symbol tone energy.

//! Two demodulators, for two different jobs. [`Spectra`] is a coarse,
//! FFT-bin-resolution scan built once per candidate start time and then

//! that candidate is scored against — cheap enough to run across a whole
//! search grid. [`goertzel_power`] is the opposite trade: one frequency,
//! exact rather than bin-snapped, used only to refine and then finally

/// happen to land in that leakage. Measured directly: unwindowed, a
/// synthesised PI4-80 transmission scored 0.996 under the PI4-96 hypothesis

/// alignment — misidentified as the wrong variant outright. Hann's sidelobes

/// pick a winner across variants at all; see `best_per_variant_at_start`.
/// [`goertzel_power`]'s later refinement pass does not have this problem — it
/// is scoring one already-identified alignment, not choosing between several
